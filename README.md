### Hey! I am [@dipankarsarkar](https://twitter.com/dipankarsarkar)(Dipankar Sarkar)üëã

I am a software architect, author, researcher and serial entrepreneur. 

I currently live in beautiful Scotland. üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø 

I have built different kinds of systems ranging from payment systems, blockchain, analytics to embedded hardware. I have worked across India, Europe, and United States within many organisations at various levels.

I created one of the earlier micro-blogging portals called [Kwippy](https://github.com/kwippy-com), wrote one of the first [book](https://github.com/dipankar/nginx-cookbook) for nginx, analytics hypervisor [octo.ai](https://github.com/octoai) and make open source contributions to [kubernetes](https://github.com/dipankar/goryCadvisor).

I like building things with Deep Learning/Machine Learning, distributed systems, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, Golang, Python, TypeScript (and JavaScript), modern backend APIs, and modern frontend frameworks. ü§ñ

I spend quite a bit of time now working on ways to use AI within businesses. In my spare time, I research, write and code around [Machine Learning/AI](https://github.com/terraprompt) & [blockchain protocols](https://github.com/cryptuon). I do work closely with web3 protocols (experience with AI, DePIN, RWA) and open to research collaborations. Feel free to contact me, if any of my work resonates. ü§ì
